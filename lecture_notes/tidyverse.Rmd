## Tidy format (murders data)

We say that a data table is in **tidy** format if each row represents
one observation and columns represent the different variables available
for each of these observations. For example, the following data is in
tidy format:

```{r murder data}
data(murders)
head(murders)
```

## Not tidy format (fertility)

The following dataset is organized, but not tidy. Why?
\scriptsize
```{r fertility_not_tidy}
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
filename <- file.path(path, "fertility-two-countries-example.csv")
wide_data <- read_csv(filename)
select(wide_data, country, `1960`:`1962`) %>% as.data.frame()
```

\normalsize

## Tidy format (fertility)

Here is how we would organize these data to be tidy:
\footnotesize
```{r fertility_tidy}
data("gapminder")
tidy_data <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("South Korea", "Germany") & 
           !is.na(fertility)) %>%
  select(country, year, fertility)
head(tidy_data, 6)
```


## Tidy format

The same information is provided, but there are important differences in
the format. For the **tidyverse** packages to be optimally used, data
need to be reshaped into \`tidy' format. The advantage of working in
tidy format allows the data analyst to focus on more important aspects
of the analysis rather than the format of the data.

## Tidy data wrangling 

The **dplyr** package, which is part of the **tidyverse**, presents a
basic grammar for wrangling tidy data: 

* mutate(): add or modify existing columns 
* select(): take a subset of the columns (variables)
* filter(): take a subset of the rows (observations) 
* arrange(): sort the rows 
* summarize(): aggregate data across rows

Note an important point: most dplyr functions (and most functions in the
tidyverse) input a tibble and then output a modified tibble!

## Mutate

The function **mutate** takes the data frame, the instructions for the
new columns in next arguments, and returns a modified data frame. For
example:

```{r mutate_1}
head(murders)
```

## Mutate
To add murder rates, we mutate as follows:

```{r mutate_2}
murdersRate <- mutate(murders,
  rate = total / population * 100000
)
head(murdersRate)
```

## Filter

Now suppose that we want to filter the data table to only show the
entries for which the murder rate is lower than 0.71. We do this as
follows:
\small
```{r filter_1}
filter(murdersRate, rate <= 0.71)
```

## Select

If we want to view just a few of our columns, we can use the following:

```{r select_1}
murdersRate <- mutate(murders,
  rate = total / population * 100000
)
murdersRateSelect <- select(murdersRate, state, rate)
filter(murdersRateSelect, rate <= 0.71)
```

## Nesting functions

Instead of defining new objects along the way, we could do everything in
one complex nested function:
\small
```{r nest}
filter(
  select(
    mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000),
    state, rate
  ),
  rate <= 0.71
)
```
\normalsize
This is fairly concise but a little confusing. Is there a better way?

## Pipes

In the previous example, we performed the following wrangling
operations:
$$ \mbox{original data } \rightarrow \mbox{ mutate } \rightarrow \mbox{ select } \rightarrow \mbox{ filter } $$

As with Unix, we can perform a series of operations in R by sending the
results of one function to another using the **pipe operator**: %\>%. As
of R version 4.1.0, you can also use \|\>.

The pipe is a combination of characters that when used properly does two
things: *It shortens and simplifies the code* and it makes the code
intuitive to read.

## Pipes

All the pipe does is provide **forward application** of an object to the
first argument of a function. The pipe sends left side of the input to
the function to the right of the pipe. For example, if we wanted to
calculate $$\log_2(\sqrt(16))$$

We could use:

```{r pipes_1}
16 %>% sqrt() %>% log2()
```

Since the pipe sends values to the first argument, we can define other
arguments as follows:

```{r pipes_2}
16 %>% sqrt() %>% log(base = 2)
```

## Pipes (murders)
Completing the prior tibble operation using pipes:

```{r pipes_3}
murders %>%
  mutate(rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  select(state, rate) %>%
  filter(rate <= 0.71)
```

Note that as you can see, the pipe operators (%\>% or \|\>) are not
specific to the tidyverse, in fact they come from the **magrittr**
package (which is loaded by the tidyverse and dplyr libraries)

## Arrange

We know about the **order** and **sort** functions, but for ordering
entire tables, the **arrange** function is much more useful. For
example, here we order the states murder rate:

\footnotesize
```{r arrange_1}
murdersRate %>%
  arrange(rate) %>%
  head()
```

## Arrange (descending order)
Note that the default behavior is to order in ascending order. The
function **desc** transforms a vector so that it is in descending order.
To sort the table in descending order, we can type:

\footnotesize
```{r arrange_2}
murdersRate %>%
  arrange(desc(rate)) %>%
  head()
```

## Nested sorting

If we are ordering by a column with ties, we can use a second (or third)
column to break the tie. for example:

\small
```{r arrange_3}
murdersRate %>%
  arrange(region, rate) %>%
  head()
```

## Summarize

The **summarize** function computes summary statistics in an intuitive
way. The 'heights' dataset includes heights and sex reported by students
in an in-class survey.

```{r summarize_1}
data(heights)
heights %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  summarize(
    avg = mean(height),
    std_dev = sd(height)
  )
```

## Group then summarize with 'group_by'

A common operation in data exploration is to first split data into
groups and then compute summaries for each group. For example, we may
want to compute the average and standard deviation for men's and women's
heights separately. We can do the following

```{r group_by_1}
heights %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(
    average = mean(height),
    standard_deviation = sd(height)
  )
```

## More on the tidyverse

In as you learn more about the tidyverse you will learn a few more tidyverse operations, including the __inner_join__, __left_join__, __pull__, __dot__, and __do__ functions, and the __tidyr__ package.

## Session info
\tiny
```{r session info}
sessionInfo()
